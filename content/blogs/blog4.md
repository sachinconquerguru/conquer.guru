How we develop ? 

We help our clients build innovative, data driven solutions that help them create more enduring customer relationships, and improve business efficiency. We use modern development methodologies including Lean, and Agile to accelerate delivery, and create value early.

What's our approach ? 

We help our clients express their project requirements clearly, and completely. We then help the make informed decisions about technologies, approach, and priorities. We make sure everything is fully documented so that the entire project team including planning, design, development, and testing has clear, unambiguous instructions on what needs to be done.

How do we design? 

Our design process is user-centric, we focus on delivering intuitive, pattern-driven experiences and interactions. By putting users at the centre of the design process, we are able to focus on delivering the things that matter, when they matter. Design should be compelling, but more importantly, it should be useful.

How do we develop applications? 

We specialise in developing web, and mobile software solutions built on JS / Python. We use frontend frameworks including React Native, Angular, Ember, and Node, and primarily use React Native for cross-platform mobile projects.

How do we test applications? 

Our testing approach uses a mix of automated and manual testing tailored to each solution. We use a range of tools to manage both automations and test plans, including Selenium, Appium, Katlon Studio and TestRail.

How do we Host applications? 

Our support team will keep things running smoothly in AWS, Firebase. Once your application is built, you want to ensure it stays up, stable, and secure. Our team will monitor your cloud services to make sure any disruptions are managed quickly and efficiently.
