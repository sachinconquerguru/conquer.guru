Turn ideas to Great products


Get new ideas to your customers fast, without compromising on security or reliability.
Start up as a service ? 

Well, that’s simple. You have an idea and you are ready for a long battle. We have a settled hard working team with winning mentality, top-notch technical skills, DevOps, experience in UI/UX, Content and SMM. We have been trained for years to make attractive, functional and successful products from the first line of code to a dozens of everyday clients. Just making things work is not enough, we build products clients love.

What's our approach ? 

During the years of development, research, study and self-improvement we have gained amazing experience in software engineering for both B2B and B2C markets. Our skills and experience allow us to solve hardest engineering problems and build complex, fully functional, top quality level solutions which will be the best answer for your business challenges.

Are you good? 

During the years of building startups we encountered a lot of tricky situations: tech problems, team issues, unpredictable customer behaviour, data leaks and loss, infrastructure crashing, legal issues, competitor’s machinations, etc. Sometimes we were at the top, sometimes things were not good at all. We’ve acquired truly unique experience and now ready to share it with you to help achieve your goals.

Why us? 

There are a million pitfalls when you run a technology company. Technology changes every day, it’s hard to combine tech with business, fine-tune proper engineering processes, ensure stable release cycle, get good people and make them work with passion - that’s only a small part of challenges. We know them all and are ready to offer you technology leadership you can trust.
